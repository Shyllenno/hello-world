# hello-world

Hi guy,

My nickname is Shyllenno, and it means very shy.

I am trying to enter into this fantastic Tech world. Coming from Finance field, I have chosen to pursue a new and exciting career, even though I am near my forties. It is never later to do that, is it? I hope not!

Right now, I am learning how to code in Python, I am still seeing everything on the console, I can't wait to start craeting User's Interfaces.

I do have a little of coding in my brain, as I came from Finance, I had to use a lot of Excel, so during all these years I have learnt coding in VBA, and it is pretty good what we can do.

I am really excited about it.

So let's do it.

I hope you all help me on this achievement.

Happy coding.
